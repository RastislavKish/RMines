# RMines

This is a remake of the well known Minesweeper game I created while learning React. It's a web application, and should therefore run on anything with a decent browser.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/RastislavKish/RMines
cd RMines
npm install
npm start
```

Or, you can use the [live version.][(https://rastislavkish.com/apps/rmines)

On the main game screen, activate the focus mode of your screenreader and focus the board grid. You can navigate using arrow keys and flag tiles using the F key. The center of the board is guaranteed not to contain mines, thus it's a good place to start.
